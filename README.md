# Meme Generator React App

This is a solution to the meme generator project from the Scrimba Learn React course.

## The Challenge

The challenge was to create a meme generator that would take top and bottom text inputs and display them over a randomly generated meme image. This was completed using form elements and calling a meme API to return a random image url. I also implemented a save meme button to save the created meme.

### What I Learned
